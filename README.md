# Rock-VS-Mine-Prediction-by-Using-ML

## Overview

This project aims to predict whether underwater objects are rocks or mines using logistic regression. The prediction model is trained on a dataset containing sonar readings, specifically the acoustic properties of objects collected from sonar signals. The model utilizes logistic regression to classify objects accurately based on their acoustic features.

## Motivation

The motivation behind this project is to apply machine learning techniques to the task of underwater object classification. By leveraging logistic regression and sonar data, this model can help distinguish between rocks and mines, contributing to tasks such as mine detection in naval operations or underwater surveying for geological studies.

## Dataset

The dataset consists of sonar readings obtained from objects submerged underwater. Each object is described by 60 features representing its acoustic properties. The dataset is loaded into a pandas DataFrame, and statistical measures such as mean, count, and description are computed to understand the data's characteristics.

## Methodology

The prediction model is implemented using logistic regression, a popular classification algorithm. The dataset is split into training and testing subsets using the `train_test_split` function from scikit-learn. Logistic regression is then applied to the training data, and the model's accuracy is evaluated using the `accuracy_score` metric.

## Implementation

The project is implemented in Python using libraries such as NumPy, pandas, and scikit-learn. The codebase loads the dataset from a CSV file and preprocesses it to separate features and labels. Logistic regression is then trained on the training data, and its accuracy is computed. 

## Usage

To use the prediction model:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Run the provided script or notebook to train the model and make predictions.
3. Customize the model or experiment with different algorithms and parameters as needed.

## Results

The logistic regression model achieves a certain level of accuracy on the training data, which indicates its effectiveness in classifying underwater objects. Further evaluation on the testing data and potential improvements to the model can be explored for enhanced performance.
